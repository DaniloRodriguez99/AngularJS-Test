# AngularJS-Test
------------ Frontend ------------

Resources I used:

AngularJs 1.7.5: I Used this version simply because it's the one I'm familiar with

Angular Material: I used it to help me and not waste too much time creating styles, I tryied leaving a neat but very simple design without dwelling so much on the detail.

Axios could have been used to have better performance on HTTP calls, I decided not to use it for show a little more skills with vanilla javascript, since in the backend I do use it

It could have been made responsive, this was not done due to lack of time

Also use a repository called "angular-seed": "This project is an application skeleton for a typical AngularJS web app.
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these projects."

Here I leave a link to the repository: https://github.com/angular/angular-seed

------------ Backend ------------

To run the server run "npm run dev"

Axios: Use this library to connect via http third party apis

Nodemon: Use Nodemon as a development dependency, to speed up app restart

Morgan: Use Morgan as middleware, and I have seen that it is very common to use it together with Express and Node to access
to the life cycles of requests and responses

I have no experience as such in node so I had almost no libraries in mind.

Missing database using MongoDB
